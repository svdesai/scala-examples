# Scala Examples: Learn by Coding üöÄ

This repository is all about learning Scala from scratch by diving into code. Each file in this repository covers a specific concept.

---

## üìù Basic Examples

Here, each file focuses on one fundamental concept to build a solid foundation before moving on to more challenging problems.

| File                    | Description                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `hello_world.scala`     | A simple Hello World program        |
| `fibonacci.scala`       | Code for calculating the Fibonacci series |
| `higher_order.scala`    | An example of a higher-order function |
| `simple_calculator.scala` | A basic calculator                |
| `simple_match.scala`    | Basics of pattern matching          |

## üí™ Challenges

Below are some slightly harder, more leetcode-ish problems which make use of simple logic, recursion, and list operations.

| File                    | Description                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `check_prime.scala`     | Checks if a number is prime         |
| `factorial.scala`       | Calculates the factorial of a number |
| `list_sum.scala`        | Sums all elements in a list         |
| `palindrome.scala`      | Checks if a word is a palindrome    |
| `second_largest.scala`  | Finds the second largest element in a list |

## üìà What‚Äôs Next?

The repository will keep growing as new examples and challenges are added. Future topics might look like:
- Functional programming concepts like immutability and pure functions
- Collections, maps, sequences, concurrency
- Leetcode solutions
